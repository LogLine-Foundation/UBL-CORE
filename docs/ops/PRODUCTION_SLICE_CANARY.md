# Production Slice Canary (M5)

## Goal

Continuously execute a narrow end-to-end workflow through UBL APIs and keep evidence as receipts and traces.

Baseline workflow:

- submit chip
- trace receipt
- verify chip integrity
- narrate receipt

## Canonical operation mode

- Canary traffic is generated by a scheduler/webhook/agent that calls `POST /v1/chips`.
- Evidence is receipt-native (`receipt_cid`, trace, narrate output), not a local script report file.
- Advisory result should be persisted as chip when applicable.

## Pass criteria per run

- 100% receipt emission success for scheduled canary events
- no validation errors in traces
- p95 and p99 latency inside your active SLO policy window

## Notes

- The old `make prod-slice-canary` script path was retired.
- Keep canary outputs in ledger form (receipt chain + external witness when needed).
