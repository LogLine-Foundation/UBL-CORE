# UBL CORE

Open-source deterministic runtime for chip processing, cryptographic receipts, policy enforcement, and operational rollout controls.

## Scope

`UBL-CORE` is the OSS foundation:

- deterministic gate pipeline (`KNOCK -> WA -> CHECK -> TR -> WF`)
- runtime and canon primitives
- receipts and attestation
- CLI, MCP gateway, stores, and core connectors

Product shells stay outside this repo and currently live at:
- [danvoulez/UBL-SHELLS](https://github.com/danvoulez/UBL-SHELLS)

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p ubl_gate
```

Gate default: `http://localhost:4000`

## Security Notes

- Production signature path is Ed25519 (receipt/runtime attestations).
- PQ dual-sign (`ML-DSA3`) is feature-gated as a rollout stub (`ubl_kms/pq_mldsa3`): wire/API shape exists and PQ signature currently returns `None` until backend integration is completed.
