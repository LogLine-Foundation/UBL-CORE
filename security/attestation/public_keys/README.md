# Docs Attestation Public Keys

Trusted public keys used to verify `UBL-CORE` docs attestation bundles.

Guidelines:

- Only commit public keys.
- Name keys with owner + creation date.
- Keep superseded keys for historical release verification.
- Record key id/fingerprint in commit or release notes when rotating.
