# Commercial Licensing and Services

## Model

`UBL-CORE` is open-source under Apache-2.0 for protocol adoption and verifiability.

Commercial offerings are expected around operations and productization layers, including:

- managed `ubl_gate` hosting and SLO/SLA support
- enterprise operations (backup/restore, incident support, compliance packaging)
- premium connectors/adapters and enterprise integrations
- advisory, migration, and rollout services

## Important Boundary

- Core protocol and verification physics remain open and inspectable.
- Paid value is delivery, scale, reliability, and enterprise integration.

## Cloud Provider / OEM Terms

If an organization needs terms beyond Apache-2.0 (for example OEM, branded managed-service rights, indemnity, or custom support commitments), a separate commercial agreement is required.

## No Hidden Lock-In Promise

Artifacts and verification produced by core protocol components should remain portable and independently verifiable by third parties.

## Contact

Commercial requests: use repository support channels in `SUPPORT.md`.
